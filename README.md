# Discord-Communication-Tool
This is a roblox scripts that uses Synapse websockets. It is connected to a node js server that is connected to "selfbot.js" another node package. These two together create a communication tool for sending/receiving messages fairly easy. Feel free to edit any of my code to your liking. Oh and also you can send gifs to discord. They just wont show up in the gui (since thats near impossible lol.)
