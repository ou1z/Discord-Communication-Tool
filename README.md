# Discord-Communication-Tool
This is a roblox scripts that uses Synapse websockets. It is connected to a node js server that is connected to "selfbot.js" another node package. These two together create a communication tool for sending/receiving messages fairly easy. Feel free to edit any of my code to your liking. Oh and also you can send gifs to discord. They just wont show up in the gui (since thats near impossible lol.)

# Tutorial / How to use
1. First run the node server on your pc.
2. And then get the client.lua script and execute it in synapse. 
3. Get the server and channel id that you want to log/send messages from/to.
4. Enjoy!
